# lol-team-analyzer

A command line tool that provides information regarding teammates, utilizing both the Riot Games Client API and Riot Games LoL API to retrieve this information. 

This tool should be ran during champion select, and will display the main role and recent ranked match win percentages for each teammate. This program utilizes roleML to determine the preferred role of each teammate based on the roles they have assumed in recent ranked matches - more information can be found here, https://github.com/Canisback/roleML.

The intention of this project was to practice working with APIs.
